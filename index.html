        <h1>Arthropods</h1>
        <p>When you think of animals, organisms such as birds or mammals may come to mind. However, if you look at the numbers, the most diverse and one of the most numerous animal groups are arthropods. They live everywhere from
        mountain peaks to ocean trecnhes, lush forests to scorching deserts, far exotic lands to your own back yard. They come in all shapes and sizes, and can eat almost anything. Many of us comment on how 'alien' or 'strange' these
        creatures look. Yet, if we look at the numbers, it is they who are the standard and we who are the aliens.
        
        On this site, I will post about arthropods or topics relating to them. Information will be given about it's habitat, diet, ecology, locomotion, life cycle and more. There is nearly 1 million known species of arthropods alive today, so
        there will be no shortage of content for quite a while. And that's just living species! That's right, extinct arthropods will also be featured. My goal is spread information and take down misconceptions about these creatures. So,
        enjoy your stay as I reveal the truly buggy world we live in.</p>
